# Introduction

The workshop's **primary objective is to help you acquire practical experience in the administration and usage of Istio service mesh**. The course will guide you through the most common practical use-cases such as service monitoring, traffic routing, canary releases, and fault injection. In addition, the course will guide you through the installation of a Kubernetes cluster and Istio, which are the prerequisites of the workshop.

Each chapter provides a short introduction to familiarize yourself with a feature or a problem and then gives step-by-step instructions describing how to achieve the goal.

Some chapters contain tasks for individual practice. They will be listed at the end of the chapter under the `Exercises` section. You are obliged to prepare a concise report summarizing the completed tasks. Please, include executed commands, applied configuration policies, or screenshots depending on the task type. Use your best judgment to decide what is essential to include in the report - there is no need to include everything. The recommended report format is PDF.

Finally, the course assumes that you have basic knowledge about Service Mesh and Isito. If you are not there yet, first read the following two pages from the Istio documentation:

* [What is Istio?](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/)
* [Istio traffic management](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/)
